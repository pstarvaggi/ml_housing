# MLproject

This is project on advanced regression techniques to predice housing prices in Ames, Iowa. The data and project are part of the corresponding Kaggle competition. 

datacleaning.R contains a data preprocessing script. This should be ran before the jupyter notebook. The input to this script are train.csv and test.csv.
The R file then writes train_final.csv and test_final.csv

MLProject_final.ipynb contains the regression models. The end result of this script are the predictions to be submitted to Kaggle
